# FAQ

## Will PennApps be online or in-person this year?

We will keep everyone updated with this status according to the COVID-19 pandemic circumstances, but as of now, PennApps is BACK in-person :)

## How much will PennApps cost me?

Not only will we provide you with a weekend's worth of swag, meals, drinks, and snacks and a place to crash when you need a break from coding, we'll even help cover your travel. When you're accepted, we'll have a page where you can submit your required travel reimbursement forms and receipts. We’ll determine a reasonable cap based on your travel from location to reimburse up to. This cycle we're excited to have even more travel reimbursements available than past years!

## Once I am accepted, what do I need to bring?

_Need:_ Laptop and charger, cellphone and charger, sleeping bag, pillow, toiletries, a couple changes of clothes (nerdy shirts are particularly appreciated). Consider bringing clothes that can get wet (We can neither confirm nor deny there may or may not be a water fight).

_Don't need:_ a pre-determined team, an idea for an app, food or drink.

_Please don't bring:_ Firearms or other weapons, alcohol, illegal drugs, soldering or similar equipment, animals (no matter how adorable).

## When/where can I hack?

PennApps will start with the kick-off ceremony at Penn Engineering Quad. There will be events planned throughout the day for those who arrive early. A detailed schedule of events and locations will be posted later. All work eligible for prizes must be completed between Friday night after the kick-off and Sunday morning.

## What can I win?

It's not about winning—it's about learning and making friends that last for a lifetime (so everyone's a winner!). If you're thinking, "that's adorable...but really," then we've got you covered too. A panel of professional judges will select the top three hacks based on the following criteria: creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and usefulness. Top prizes are TBA, but usually involve thousands of dollars and insane perks from company sponsors. Most sponsors offer their own prizes too for specific categories, which they judge and fund themselves. We had well over $40k worth of prizes up for grabs last time including Nintendo Switches and Oculus Rifts, if you like numbers.

## What's the application process like?

We're looking for creative, innovative, and team-oriented hackers with a set of skills – mobile, web, hardware, design, or anything else that can contribute to a project. We generally prefer applicants who showcase their ability through links, project descriptions, Github profiles, video demos or participation/awards in other hackathons. We love first-time hackers who show us what makes you special in whatever way is most natural.

## When will applications close?

The application will close July 20th at 11:59pm EDT.

## Who can apply?

Any college, university, or high school student 15 years or older on September 2nd, 2022 is eligible to apply.

## Should Penn students fill out the application too?

Penn students MUST also fill out the application with their Penn email to sign up. Penn students are automatically accepted into the hackathon and have a later application deadline than non-penn students.

## I'm not a student. How can I get involved?

Unfortunately, we can't allow you to participate in the event or be on site during hacking. If you're looking to mentor (i.e. someone with technical skills who'd be willing to help out participants during the weekend) or lead a workshop (i.e. speakers that lead events on topics that they are passionate about to the hackers), reach out to us at contact@pennapps.com. Otherwise, you can see the finished products at the demos on Sunday (time and location TBA).

## How is PennApps run?

PennApps is planned almost entirely by University of Pennsylvania students, with some advice and assistance from our friends at Penn Engineering. One hundred percent of the funding for PennApps comes from corporate sponsor donations. You can find more information about sponsoring at our sponsor section.

## How should I behave?

Be respectful and considerate of your fellow hackers. We're all here to learn and have a good time. Everyone deserves the chance to hack free of the fear of being harrassed.

## What should I do if I have additional questions or want to express my limitless gratitude?

Aw shucks. Shoot us an email at contact@pennapps.com!
